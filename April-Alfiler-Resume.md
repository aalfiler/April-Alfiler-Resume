#### [Seriously Delinquent](https://github.com/aalfiler/Seriously_Delinquent)
Financial institutions receive an overwhelming amount of credit card and loan applications. Going through each request manually is time consuming and prone to human error. With ML, we can build a model that can aid decision making for lenders and borrowers to predict potential future financial delinquency.
- Build a ML model that can predict whether borrowers will experience financial distress in the next two years. 
- Jupyter Lab, Google Colab, Amazon Lex
- ML models: Random forest, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, AdaBoost, KNN, Multilayer Perception and XGBoost


## Experience

#### Supervisor, Study Management
#### Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp. Seattle, WA, July 2018 – Present 

Initially hired as a Data Specialist and quickly advanced to a Supervisor role. Day-to-day supervision of a team of seven who are responsible for activating biological samples for production lab processing.

#### Key Accomplishments:
- Lead a team with direct contribution to 60% of the annual corporate goal.
- Prepare periodic sample forecasts to help Supply Chain, Production Lab, and Senior Operations Management plan for sufficient materials, labor and overhead for processing samples.
- Collaborate cross-functionally with Research and Development, Antigen Map Program, SoftwareEngineering, Business Development, Quality Control and Production Lab to
- Reduced turnaround time from shipme nt arrival to order activation by 75% within two quarters.
- Coordinated the processing of 12,000 COVID-19 samples in the production lab when the company pivoted priorities in Q2 2020. Data generated from genetic sequencing resulted in the T-Detect COVIDTM product launched in December 2020 and gained Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA in March 2021

### Data Coordinator II, Women’s Health Initiative 
#### Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, Sept 2016 – March 2018
